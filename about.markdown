Hi!

Welcome to my personal website.

My name is **Joel Valerian**, currently I'm a **Physics Undergraduate Student** at **Universitas Indonesia**. My field specialization is **Medical Physics**, especially Radiotherapy. I routinely teach High School Physics & Math for private lessons and also work as a **Teaching Assitant** for some basic physics courses (see list below) in my university. I also **play trumpet** in **Universitas Indonesia Student Orchestra Mahawaditra**.

Beside Medical Physics, I'm also highly interested in:
1.  The broad range of Theoretical Physics (although not proficient enough to speak about it)
2. Computer Science (just the AI and Computational Physics bit)
3. Fusion Energy (I hope we get there soon).

In this website you can find all kinds of links, lecture notes, compilation of teaching material, archieved document, blog posts, etc. **Basically anything online, digital, and not private I will post here**.

If you have any question, query, or things to talk about, **please do e-mail me about it**. I will certainly read it and reply if required.

Enjoy browsing here!
